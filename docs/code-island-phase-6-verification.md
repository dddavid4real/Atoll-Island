# Code Island Phase 6 Verification

**Status:** Complete

**Date:** 2026-08-04; arbitration amended 2026-08-05 by ADR 0011

**Scope:** Multi-session dashboard, compact agent activity, selective pop-outs,
Atoll-owned arbitration, origin handoff, and exact-origin suppression. Phase 7
release hardening remains unauthorized.

## Delivered contract

### Metadata-only multi-session dashboard

- `CodeIslandDashboardProjection` accepts only `SessionMetadata`. It cannot
  carry prompt text, commands, questions, answers, tool input, or raw hook
  payloads into the UI.
- Dashboard rows are ordered by the frozen urgency contract: waiting first,
  then working, then recent completion/failure. The longest-waiting session is
  first; working and recent rows are newest first; ties have stable provider and
  opaque-session ordering.
- Cancelled and ended sessions are omitted. Setup and idle states remain in the
  persistent Code Island tab, and active rows expose only agent, project/session
  identity, content-free status, timestamp, and an **Open in origin** action.
- The tab keeps Atoll typography, controls, scrolling, geometry, settings
  navigation, and accessibility structure.

### Pure presentation policy and deterministic queue

- The provider runtime still emits sanitized state and presentation intents;
  it does not select tabs, open Atoll, activate applications, or play UI.
- A pure policy accepts an intent plus Atoll's occupancy projection:
  `available`, `noncritical`, or `systemOrPrivacy`. It returns present, enqueue,
  suppress, state-only, or dismiss.
- System, privacy, lock, and protected HUD states win. Code Island processing,
  starts, attention handoffs, completions, and failures displace noncritical
  content and queue only while a protected activity is present.
- Deferred work has stable semantic priority: attention, failure, completion,
  then start. Newer state for the same provider/session replaces an older
  queued presentation instead of producing stale duplicates.
- Start animation lasts two seconds, completion five seconds, and a future
  verified failure presentation four seconds. Blocking handoffs persist until
  the provider changes state or ends. Codex currently cannot emit a verified
  failure intent, so that treatment remains capability-gated.
- Routine working updates change dashboard/compact state only. No ordinary
  event opens the Code Island tab. Starts and completions never steal focus.

### Atoll-hosted CodeIsland identity

- The active presentation uses a focused, payload-free extraction of
  CodeIsland's Dex pixel-cloud mascot and motion. It is a reusable SwiftUI view,
  not CodeIsland's panel, application shell, or window controller.
- Atoll owns the containing notch shape, width, height, transitions, tab route,
  and lifecycle. No `NSPanel`, second application, updater, settings window, or
  status item was introduced.
- A working Codex session receives the primary compact agent live activity over
  noncritical media, timers, reminders, recording, transfers, extensions, and
  similar live activity. It never occupies the music secondary slot. Protected
  system and privacy presentations still take priority.
- Clicking the compact activity is user-initiated navigation to the persistent
  Code Island tab. A blocking handoff contains no decision control and offers
  only **Open in origin**.

### Exact-origin suppression and handoff

- Suppression requires an exact session-specific handle and no conflicting
  known handle. An application bundle match alone always remains uncertain.
- Phase 6 can positively verify Terminal.app by selected-tab TTY and iTerm2 by
  selected session ID. A different tab/pane/app produces a non-match; an
  unsupported or application-only observation remains unknown. Both cases
  present rather than suppress.
- Visibility scripts run away from the main UI path and the frontmost
  application is rechecked after the query to reject a stale result.
- The managed helper resolves its controlling `/dev/tty` as a navigation-only
  handle when Codex delivers hook input through a pipe, making Terminal.app's
  selected-tab TTY comparison reachable without reading terminal contents.
- Origin handoff precisely selects a matching Terminal.app tab or iTerm2
  session when its handle is available. Other origins receive only a
  user-initiated application activation. No provider decision or answer is
  generated on either path.

## Provider boundary

Codex remains **Monitoring**. The verified `PermissionRequest` lifecycle event
can create a metadata-only approval handoff while Codex's own prompt stays in
control. Interactive question observation remains unavailable, and rich tool
output is still not inspected to infer failure. Phase 6 did not promote the
provider capability or modify the Phase 5 bridge/installer contract.

Imported rich views, other provider mascots/icons, and feature-sound resources
remain quarantined. Resource selection, signing, accessibility, localization,
and release/rollback exercises belong to the separately authorized Phase 7
hardening pass.

## Verification evidence

Local verification completed:

- All 28 repository Python-driven regressions passed in 267.982 seconds. The
  suite recompiles and executes the Phase 2 through Phase 6 Swift contract
  programs plus the real Phase 5 helper/listener/runtime regressions.
- The Phase 6 executable runner proves urgency ordering, filtering, occupancy
  policy, Code-Island-vs-noncritical priority, protected-system priority,
  deterministic deferred ordering, positive exact matching, application-only
  uncertainty, false-match presentation, and exact-match suppression.
- Focused XCTest coverage for the same Core/Runtime policy was added for CI.
- The Swift package builds successfully in Debug and Release against the local
  macOS 15.4 SDK with writable isolated caches and an explicit macOS target.
- A clean Debug package build plus the focused host/notch and AppKit-origin
  type checks also pass at Atoll's macOS 14.6 deployment target.
- The actual Atoll host plus notch route type-check against the built package
  modules using only a stubbed AppKit origin boundary. The actual origin adapter
  separately type-checks against AppKit and built Code Island modules.
- Every changed Swift file passes parser validation. `git diff --check` and the
  package-boundary assertions pass.

This machine has Command Line Tools rather than full Xcode. `swift test`
reaches the test target but fails at the pre-existing local limitation
`no such module 'XCTest'`. The complete Atoll application build, real resource
embedding, accessibility/localization QA, and signing/notarization remain CI or
Phase 7 gates.

## Verification commands

Run from the Atoll repository root:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -v -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
python3 -m unittest tests.test_code_island_phase_six_presentation
swift build --package-path Packages/CodeIsland --disable-sandbox
swift build -c release --package-path Packages/CodeIsland --disable-sandbox
swift test --package-path Packages/CodeIsland
plutil -lint DynamicIsland.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
git diff --check
```

On a Command Line Tools installation with the newer default SDK/compiler
mismatch, select a compatible SDK and set writable module, cache, and scratch
paths as in the recorded local build invocation.

## Phase 7 supersession

Phase 7 was subsequently authorized and implemented. Its accessibility,
localization, resource, upgrade/rollback, and release-artifact gates are
recorded in [Code Island Phase 7 Verification](code-island-phase-7-verification.md).
Credentialed signing and notarization remain release-workflow gates rather than
claims made by this historical Phase 6 record.
