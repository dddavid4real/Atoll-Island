# Changelog

All notable changes to Atoll will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Unsigned public beta path**: Added fork-owned installation guidance, a
  manual prerelease workflow, checksum publication, and an explicit Gatekeeper
  disclosure while Apple Developer ID signing remains unavailable.
- **Code Island integration**: Added Codex session monitoring as a persistent Atoll panel and Atoll-owned live activity, with explicit activation, origin-only approvals and answers, sanitized metadata persistence, grouping and retention controls, optional Dex visuals and audited sounds, guided legacy adoption, localization/accessibility seams, and signed-release bundle verification.
- **AntiGravity Usage Tracking**: Track how much of Antigravity usage is left in the LLM Usage Monitor tab (both Gemini and Claude models)
- **Shelf item removal**: Hovering a Shelf item now reveals a × button that removes just that item, with a VoiceOver-accessible "Remove from Shelf" action that works without hovering (#461).

### Changed
- Rebased the public product version as Atoll Island 0.1.0 and separated its
  release identity from upstream Atoll 2.3.3.
- Improved the Dutch localization by adding missing translations, corrected terminology, and wording aligned with Apple's Dutch macOS conventions.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where `BluetoothHUDAnimations` (.mov files) were missing in release builds.
- Improved the GitHub Actions release workflow to use a monotonic build number allocator and automated patch versioning for stable releases.
- Fixed Cursor quota parsing and display to show the current Cursor Models and Other Models billing buckets with readable long reset durations.
- Fixed files dropped onto the Shelf silently disappearing on macOS 26 (Tahoe) by storing plain bookmarks instead of security-scoped ones, which a non-sandboxed app cannot create (#646).
- Fixed the AirPods pause gesture opening Siri instead of pausing Spotify: the real-time waveform no longer process-taps Spotify while a Bluetooth output route is active, and the tap is rebuilt whenever the output route changes.
- Fixed Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Conversation Awareness labels being clipped behind the notch in the AirPods listening-mode HUD; every mode is now trailing-aligned and scales down instead of scrolling.
