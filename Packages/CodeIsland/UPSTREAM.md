```

## Atoll-only changes

Phases 1 through 7 intentionally replace the imported application and provider
boundaries:

- Replaces the standalone `CodeIsland` application product with internal
  `CodeIslandCore`, `CodeIslandRuntime`, and `CodeIslandUI` libraries.
- Replaces the blocking upstream bridge with a Codex-only, deadline-bounded
  helper. It reduces raw provider input locally, sends only the strict metadata
  wire to Atoll, emits `{}` only for Codex `Stop`, and emits no approval or
  question decision.
- Introduces new metadata-only Core projection, archive, file store, capability
  registry, and Codex lifecycle adapter rather than activating rich upstream
  equivalents. The adapter recognizes only documented Codex lifecycle events,
  treats compact SessionStart as continuity, and does not inspect arbitrary
  tool output to manufacture a failure signal.
- Links the three library products and embeds the signed helper inside the one
  Atoll application. Atoll remains the only application lifecycle and window,
  settings, and update owner.
- Adds content-free activity intents, an urgency-ordered metadata dashboard,
  and a pure Atoll-occupancy presentation policy.
- Extracts the Codex Dex mascot into a payload-free reusable SwiftUI component.
  Atoll supplies geometry, timing, queueing, tab selection, and origin actions;
  the imported panel/window shell and rich session views remain quarantined.
- Replaces the broad upstream terminal helpers with a conservative Atoll host
  adapter. Exact suppression is currently positive only for Terminal.app TTY
  or iTerm2 session-ID matches; application-only visibility remains uncertain.
- Replaces the upstream install-on-launch behavior with Codex-only read-only
  discovery, explicit plan-bound consent, listener-before-installer ordering,
  exact ownership receipts, receipt-gated restart and repair, digest-verified
  helper removal, and conservative stale-socket reclamation.
- Replaces recognized legacy CodeIsland hook handlers only after consent,
  stores their semantic backup in Atoll's receipt, prevents duplicate legacy
  raw delivery, and restores the handlers on deactivation while preserving
  unrelated and concurrently added hooks.
- Adds an Atoll-owned, content-free feature-preference snapshot and a
  default-off guided import of only the legacy values the merged product can
  apply. Provider, security, responder, lifecycle, remote, and webhook settings
  remain outside the import boundary.
- Packages exactly four individually audited upstream sound assets, a dedicated
  Code Island string catalog, and the complete MIT license in the active
  `CodeIslandUI` resource bundle. A release verifier rejects modified resources,
  missing attribution, duplicate helpers, and standalone CodeIsland products.

### Migration staging

| Upstream area | Current disposition | Earliest remaining migration phase |
|---|---|---|
| Rich Core models, normalizers, transcript readers, provider scanners, and retained upstream tests | `Sources/CodeIslandCore/Upstream`; excluded from SwiftPM. New sanitized Phase 2 contracts are active beside the quarantine. | Provider-neutral pieces only when their metadata boundary is proven |
| `HookServer`, `ConfigInstaller`, provider resources, and origin helpers | `Sources/CodeIslandRuntime/Upstream`; excluded from SwiftPM. Focused Codex discovery, metadata transport, activation, preflight, receipt, repair, managed installer, presentation policy, and Atoll-owned origin adapter implementations replace them. | Additional providers require their own verified rollout |
| Mascots, sounds, icons, and reusable visual candidates | `Sources/CodeIslandUI/Upstream`; excluded from SwiftPM. A focused, payload-free Dex mascot and four hash-audited sound effects are active beside the quarantine; unused mascots, sounds, icons, and application-oriented views remain excluded. | Migrate only individually adapted resources with an Atoll-owned presentation contract |

Core migration staging is deliberate: the imported `SessionSnapshot`, hook
models, `JSONLTailer`, and provider scanners expose rich or provider-specific
data and therefore do not satisfy Atoll's public Core contract unchanged.

### Deliberately removed areas

- Application ownership: `CodeIslandApp`, `AppDelegate`, panel/settings/status
  controllers, `UpdateChecker`, Sparkle, app entitlements, app icons, appcast,
  build/release scripts, and standalone documentation.
- Monolithic application state and responder UI: `AppState` and its extensions,
  application `Models`, `NotchPanelView`, settings views, global hotkeys,
  display/window helpers, and debug harnesses. These are replaced by focused
  Atoll host adapters and sanitized package APIs rather than migrated wholesale.
- Rich persistence and diagnostics: `SessionPersistence`,
  `DiagnosticsExporter`, and transcript-backed application state. Phase 2
  introduced a new typed metadata archive and file store; none of the rich
  upstream persistence is compiled.
- Active Codex response ownership: `CodexAppServerClient`,
  `AppState+CodexAppServer`, and the original blocking bridge implementation.
  The replacement lifecycle-hook bridge cannot produce provider control output.
  The app-server question path remains excluded, so Codex is still labeled
  Monitoring.
- Deferred services and platforms: remote hosts, SSH, Buddy, Bluetooth, ESP32,
  Android, iPhone, and Apple Watch sources and resources.
- Obsolete application tests: `CodeIslandTests` depended on the removed
  executable and app monolith. Relevant behaviors must return as focused tests
  when their replacement Runtime, UI, or Atoll host seam is implemented.
  Upstream Core tests are retained beside their quarantined sources; removed
  responder, companion, ESP32, and performance tests remain recoverable from
  the subtree parent and must be reconsidered with the matching migration.

Every removed file remains available through the subtree parent commit above.
An upstream refresh must follow this mapping and must not reintroduce a second
application lifecycle, responder UI, remote/Buddy code, or rich persistence.

## Refresh procedure

1. Review upstream changes from the last recorded commit.
2. Pull history without squashing:

   ```sh
   git subtree pull --prefix=Packages/CodeIsland \
     https://github.com/wxtsky/CodeIsland.git main
   ```

3. Resolve the expected conflicts at `Package.swift`, migration-staging paths,
   and deliberately removed areas; never accept those areas wholesale.
4. Update the imported commit, date, Atoll-only patch list, and verification
   evidence in this ledger.

## Verification

Run from the Atoll repository root:

```sh
python3 -m unittest tests.test_code_island_package_boundary
python3 -m unittest tests.test_code_island_phase_two_contracts
python3 -m unittest tests.test_code_island_phase_three_dashboard \
  tests.test_code_island_phase_three_activity \
  tests.test_code_island_phase_three_settings
python3 -m unittest tests.test_code_island_phase_four_contracts
python3 -m unittest tests.test_code_island_phase_five_contracts
python3 -m unittest tests.test_code_island_phase_six_presentation
python3 -m unittest \
  tests.test_code_island_phase_seven_release \
  tests.test_code_island_phase_seven_bundle
python3 -m unittest tests.test_privacy_configuration
python3 -m unittest tests.test_timer_lifecycle
swift test --package-path Packages/CodeIsland
scripts/verify-code-island-bundle.sh '/path/to/Atoll Island.app'
```

Swift validation requires a selected Xcode or Command Line Tools installation
whose compiler and macOS SDK versions match.
